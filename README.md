# GuiGeometry

There are a few good geometry gems already available for Ruby (ruby-geometry and geometry), but I need one which is focused on the needs of creating 2D graphical user interfaces.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'gui_geometry'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:
